This is a fun project to produce the pulses as the MultiSIgnalGene do, but as an discrete electronic version.

Check the branch NT. The goal is to get a more synchronous schematic rather than a monostable based schematic. With this improvement, the width of the pulses can be adjusted, while keeping the symmetry.

The input is a square or a sine signal, the pulses are generated using the peak (positive or negative) of the input.

It has been only tested at a functional level. Especially, the operational amplifiers model are very basic.

DO NOT reuse the models for another simulation. They have been designed as "simple stupid" in order to speed up spice.

The project is based on gEda/Lepton-eda

The project contains only the sources. To get exports of the schematics, parts lists, spice circuits or (later or never) the spice results, check in the artifact
