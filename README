This is a fun project to produce the pulses as the MultiSIgnalGene do, but as a discrete electronic version.

The input is a square or a sine signal, the pulses are generated using the peak (positive or negative) of the input.

It has been only tested at a functional level. Especially, the operational amplifiers model are very basic.

DO NOT reuse the models for another simulation. They have been designed as "simple stupid" in order to speed up spice.

The project is based on gEda/Lepton-eda

The project contains only the sources. To get exports of the schematics, parts lists, spice circuits or (later or never) the spice results, check in the artifact
