This is a fun project to produce the pulses as the MultiSIgnalGene do, but as an discrete electronic version.

The brach separ_pulses is more up to date and have some FPGA support.

The width of the pulses can be adjusted, while keeping the symmetry.

The input is a square or a sine signal, the pulses are generated using the peak (positive or negative) of the input.

It has been only tested at a functional level. Especially, the operational amplifiers model are very basic.

DO NOT reuse the models for another simulation. They have been designed as "simple stupid" in order to speed up spice.

The project is based on gEda/Lepton-eda

The project contains only the sources. To get exports of the schematics, parts lists, spice circuits or (later or never) the spice results, check in the artifact

The partslist points LF355 operational amplifiers, many can be used
The X1 is a preamplifier, according to the input level, its resistors should be adjusted
The counters U13 and U14 does not use the reset (which is done by load 0). Then both 74HC161 and 74HC163 can be used
The counter U14 does not count above 7. Then 74HC160 and 74HC162 can be used as well.
